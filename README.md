In this project, we will be working on a health insurance dataset. The dataset contains 1338 samples with 7 variables (Age, Sex, BMI, Number of Children, Smoker, Region, and Medical Costs). This dataset has only been on Kaggle for one month and there have been two contributors who implemented correlation matrices and did exploratory data analysis with various visualization methods (box plots, histograms, pie chart, violin plot, etc.). We hope to further this analysis by implementing deep neural networks to create a better predictive model for Medical Costs given the independent variables.
